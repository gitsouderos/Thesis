Hey Ece, just a quick update, I have created and tested 2 unconditional diffusion models with different architectures as their neural net (Normal FNN and a Residual NN) on one dimensional stock data and 9 dimensional data. The results were not that great, although not horrible. In the following days I am planning to implement more commonly used in the research neural nets and also build a conditional diffusion model which would incorporate a context window which should improve the performance by a lot.
